# Mantel_project "Print product labels"

This is a sample of the code I wrote while working at Mantel for the project "Print product labels". 

The php-html file is part of the raw written in html using PHP as a scripting language, and the styling is applied to the components by using utility classes from Bootstrap as a css framework. 

The javaScript.js file is the JavaScript code to apply the functionalities, by showing the warnings and disabling the button when a product without an url and a label with a QR is added to the list.
